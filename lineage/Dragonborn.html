            <p><b>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the Dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, Dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some Dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Ability Score Suggestion:</b> Strength +2 and Charisma +1</li>
              <li><b>Age:</b> Young Dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old Human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</li>
              <li><b>Alignment:</b> Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous Dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</li>
              <li><b>Size:</b> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than Humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</li>
              <li><b>Type:</b> You are a Humanoid.</li>
              <li><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet</li>
              <li><b>Draconic Ancestry:</b> You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon from the below list; this determines the damage and area of your breath weapon, and the type of resistance you gain.</li>

              <li><b>Breath Weapon:</b> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes <u>2d8</u> damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (<u>3d8</u>), 11th level (<u>4d8</u>), and 17th level (<u>5d8</u>). You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
