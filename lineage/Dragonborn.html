            <p><b>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the Dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, Dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some Dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</b><br>
            <b>Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons - scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads, some have tails while others do not - and their coloration and other freatures are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Type:</b> You are a Humanoid.</li>
              <li><b>Size:</b> Dragonborn are heavier than Humans and generally taller, able to stand well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</li>
              <li><b>Ability Score Suggestion:</b> Strength +2 and Charisma +1</li>
              <li><b>Age:</b> Young Dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old Human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</li>
              <li><b>Alignment:</b> Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous Dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</li>
              <li><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet</li>
              <li><b>Languages:</b> You can read, speak, and write Common and Draconic.</li>
              <li><b>Draconic Ancestry:</b> You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon from the below list:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Breath Weapon:</b>  When you take the Attack Action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhale of destructive energy in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (choose on each attack). It deals damage in an area according to your ancestry. When you use your breath weapon, Each creature in that area must make a DEX saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON modifier + your proficiency bonus). A creature takes 1d10 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th, and 4d10 at 17th level. You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</li>
                <li><b>Damage Resistance:</b> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your ancestry.</li>
