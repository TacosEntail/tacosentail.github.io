            <p><b>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred for goblins and orcs - these common threads unite all Dwarves.</b><br>
            <p><b>Dwarves were raised from the earth in the elder days by a deity of the forge. Called by various names on different worlds-Morad in, Reorx, and others-that god gave Dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground . The god also made them resilient like the mountains, with a life span of about 350 years. Squat and often bearded, the original Dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds-especially of the little overcoming the mighty. On some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, and the families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves Hill or Mountain Dwarves, respectively.</b></p>

                <li><b>Stonecunning:</b> As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked. You can use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</li>
                <li><b>Wards and Seals:</b> You can cast the <a href="../Spells/1st/Alarm.html">Alarm</a> and <a href="../Spells/1st/Mage Armor.html">Mage Armor</a> spells with this trait.

They are more thorough than speedy, and although a Dwarf's work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a Dwarf will see that it is done correctly. And when a Dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built, if not better — and it will last.</b></p>
