Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves. The Drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian or other shades of purple and blue, and have stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They lend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</b></p>

One type (which includes the Gray Elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the High Elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.<br>
                The Sun Elves of Faerun (also called Gold Elves or Sunrise Elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blood. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called Silver Elves or Gray Elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-while, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</b></p>

              <h5 class="title" style="padding-top: 10px;">Astral Elf</h5>
              <p><b>Long ago, groups of Elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an Astral Elf's eyes.<br>
                Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, Astral Elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, Astral Elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral Elves who don't dwell in the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.</b></p>

              <p><b>Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh’s food supply is grown by Elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane’s ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients.<br>
                Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred Elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive Elves even exist.</b></p>

              <h5 class="title" style="padding-top: 10px;">Vahadar Elf</h5>
              <p><b>The Vahadar are Elves who dwell in the cities of Kaladesh. They are comfortable with technology, and work as planners, architects, aether-seers, or inventors. Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways. The Vahadar are generally integrated into the rest of society on Kaladesh, living in cities dominated by the other races (though, as in Ghirapur, many of them live in specific garden-like neighborhoods) and engaging in trade.</b></p>

              <h5 class="title" style="padding-top: 10px;">Tajuru Elf</h5>
              <p><b>The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main Elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans. Tajuru Elves are the most open to people of other races, seeing their skills and perspectives as valuable new tools for survival. The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.</b></p>

              <h5 class="title" style="padding-top: 10px;">Juraga Elf</h5>
              <p><b>The Elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar — or even for other Elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves' only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans' aggressive exterior.</b></p>

              <h5 class="title" style="padding-top: 10px;">Mul Daya Elf</h5>
              <p><b>Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other Elves by their relationship with the spirits of their Elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the Elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.<br>
                Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.</b></p>
